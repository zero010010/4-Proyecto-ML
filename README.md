<h1 align="center"> USING MACHINE LEARNING TO PREDICT CARBON FOOT PRINT 🌏 </h1>
<h3 align="center"> This multifaceted dataset covers a broad range of features related to individual habits, lifestyle choices, demographics, and environmental impacts. In particular, it focuses on factors that contribute to carbon emissions like diet, transportation usage, energy sources, and consumption patterns. Additionally, it includes personal attributes such as body type, gender, and social activity levels. With over 50 features capturing environmental impacts alongside demographic and behavioral traits, this diverse dataset enables targeted marketing and customer segmentation analysis.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-Blo"> INTRODUCTION </h2>

<p align="justify"> 

This Notebook outlines a comprehensive analysis focusing on machine learning (ML) to predict carbon footprints using a dataset containing demographic, behavioral, and environmental attributes. It begins with an exploration of various ML models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Kmeans, and a glimpse at Keras Neural Network. The dataset is described as sizable and clean, with no missing data, making it suitable for ML modeling and statistical analysis. However, the main challenge is the low correlations between the features and the target variable, which may hinder the training of accurate ML models. The document explores different ML algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Support Vector Regression, evaluating their performance in terms of R-squared and Mean Absolute Errors. It also delves into unsupervised ML models, particularly Kmeans and DBSCAN, to cluster the data and gain insights without directly predicting the target variable.

The analysis provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of different ML models. For instance, the Linear Regression model is found to explain about 57% of the variance in the training data, with a need for tuning to improve its performance. The Decision Tree Regression model outperforms Ridge and Lasso Regression in terms of R-squared, indicating a better fit to the data, but still exhibits some variability and potential overfitting. The document also highlights the application of Kmeans for customer classification and targeting, as well as the potential use of the Linear Regression model to create a carbon footprint calculator and develop an app that connects with environmental NGOs to raise awareness and incentivize carbon footprint reduction. Overall, the project is presented as an opportunity to strengthen skills in Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and core data science concepts, with a focus on further exploration of advanced ML algorithms to improve predictions.

In summary, the document offers a detailed exploration of ML models and their application in predicting carbon footprints. It underscores the importance of addressing low feature-target correlations and potential overfitting in training accurate ML models, while also highlighting the potential applications of the models in creating awareness, targeting customers, and promoting sustainable practices. The analysis provides a solid foundation for further exploration of advanced ML algorithms and real-world problem-solving in the field of environmental impact assessment and mitigation.
